## Contributing

[Fork the repository] and use [Git] to clone your copy:

    $ git clone https://github.com/<username>/haskellnews/

Using [Stack], build the project:

    $ stack build

Note. If you are a [Cabal] user, please help out and submit a PR with the
relevant Cabal commands to get started. Much appreciated!

Meanwhile, you can create a local copy of the necessary configuration:

    $ cp haskellnews.conf.sample haskellnews.conf

Create a development PostgreSQL database:

    $ sudo su postgres --command 'createuser haskellnews -P'
    $ sudo su postgres --command 'createdb haskellnews -O haskellnews'

Then, create the initial version:

    $ stack exec haskellnews haskellnews.conf create-version

Import Haskell content with:

    $ stack exec haskellnews haskellnews.conf github
    $ stack exec haskellnews haskellnews.conf import

Note. Your `haskellnews` database now has a `public` table full of `item`s.

And finally, run the server:

    $ stack exec haskellnews haskellnews.conf
